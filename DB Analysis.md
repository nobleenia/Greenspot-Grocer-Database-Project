# Analysis of Database Development Process

## 1. Anomalies and Problems in the Original Dataset
- **Incomplete Data**:
  - Missing `VendorID` for vendors and `InventoryID` in the inventory table caused ambiguity during the initial schema design.
  - Some products lacked inventory details (`QuantityOnHand` and `PurchaseDate`).

- **Dirty Data**:
  - Data inconsistencies (e.g., varying formats for dates and item descriptions).
  - Duplicate or conflicting entries in orders.

- **Poor Data Organization**:
  - All fields were combined into a single spreadsheet, creating redundancy (e.g., vendors listed repeatedly with each product).

---

## 2. How the Database Design Addresses These Issues
- **Normalization**:
  - The database design follows normalization principles by creating separate tables for `Products`, `Vendors`, `Orders`, and `Inventory`.
  - Foreign keys (`VendorID`, `ItemNum`) link related tables, reducing redundancy.

- **Data Validation**:
  - Relationships enforced by foreign keys prevent invalid entries (e.g., orders referencing non-existent products).
  - Proper data types ensure consistent formats (e.g., `DATE` for `PurchaseDate` and `DateSold`).

- **Improved Organization**:
  - Vendors are assigned unique `VendorID`s, simplifying relationships with products.
  - Inventory and orders are linked to products via `ItemNum`, ensuring accurate tracking of stock and sales.

---

## 3. How the Database Supports Business Growth
- **Scalability**:
  - The relational model allows for easy expansion of product lines, vendors, and customer data without altering the core structure.
  - Adding new attributes (e.g., product categories, supplier contact details) is straightforward.

- **Efficiency**:
  - Queries like monthly revenue and out-of-stock products provide insights for decision-making, improving operational efficiency.
  - Relationships between tables streamline reporting, eliminating manual data aggregation.

- **Integrity**:
  - Enforced relationships ensure data accuracy and reliability, essential for business scaling.

---

## 4. Suggestions for Future Improvements
- **Add Customer Table**:
  - Create a `Customers` table to store customer details (`CustomerID`, `Name`, `ContactInfo`), linking it to `Orders`.

- **Enhance Inventory Tracking**:
  - Include columns for restock dates and supplier details in the `Inventory` table.
  - Track inventory movements (e.g., restocking, shrinkage).

- **Advanced Analytics**:
  - Add stored procedures or triggers for real-time alerts (e.g., low stock notifications).
  - Incorporate advanced reporting capabilities (e.g., product profitability analysis).

- **Data Cleaning Pipeline**:
  - Implement a data pipeline to clean and validate raw data before import, ensuring consistency.

- **Future Tables**:
  - Introduce tables for promotions, discounts, or customer feedback, enabling more targeted marketing and operations.

---

## Key Takeaways from the Errors
- **Error: Subquery Returning Multiple Rows**:
  - The query design needed aggregation adjustments, highlighting the importance of understanding how subqueries interact with grouped results.
  
- **Error: `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` Mode**:
  - Queries must align with strict SQL standards, emphasizing the need for grouping all non-aggregated columns.

- **Output Issues**:
  - Queries produced meaningful results, but some lacked clear organization (e.g., grouping by year/month should clarify trends).

---

## Conclusion
This database design resolves significant issues in the original dataset, provides a scalable structure for future growth, and enables actionable business insights. Further refinements, such as customer tracking and advanced analytics, would make it even more robust and valuable for long-term business needs.

# Greenspot Grocer Database Project

## Overview
This project involved transforming Greenspot Grocer's unwieldy spreadsheet data into a structured, scalable relational database. The database supports the company’s growth as it expands product lines and improves inventory management and reporting.

---

## Project Objectives
1. Analyze the original dataset for anomalies and potential problems.
2. Design a relational database structure to address these issues.
3. Create and populate the database with normalized tables.
4. Test and verify the database design using sample queries.
5. Propose future enhancements for scalability and usability.

---

## Steps Followed

### 1. Setup
- Installed MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench.
- Configured a connection to the MySQL Server.

### 2. Planning
- Analyzed the dataset to identify logical groupings of data.
- Identified key entities: `Products`, `Vendors`, `Inventory`, and `Orders`.

### 3. Database Design
- Created an Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram to visualize the database structure.
- Defined relationships between entities:
  - `Products` linked to `Vendors` via `VendorID`.
  - `Inventory` and `Orders` linked to `Products` via `ItemNum`.

### 4. Table Creation
- Implemented the database schema in MySQL Workbench using SQL:
  - `Vendors`: Stores vendor details.
  - `Products`: Stores product details linked to vendors.
  - `Inventory`: Tracks stock levels and purchase information.
  - `Orders`: Logs customer orders and sales details.

### 5. Data Import
- Imported data from CSV files into respective tables.
- Cleaned and validated data during the import process.

### 6. Testing
- Executed SQL queries to test relationships and retrieve insights:
  - Monthly revenue and order quantities.
  - Out-of-stock products.
  - Product revenue contributions.
- Resolved errors, including issues with subqueries and grouping.

---

## Results
- The database successfully stores and organizes data, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy.
- Sample queries demonstrate the database’s ability to support inventory management, sales reporting, and vendor tracking.

---

## Future Enhancements
1. **Customer Table**: Track customer details for better order management.
2. **Advanced Inventory Tracking**: Add restock dates and movement tracking.
3. **Analytics**: Enable advanced reporting and real-time alerts.
4. **Data Cleaning Pipeline**: Automate data validation and cleaning.

---

## Tools Used
- **MySQL Workbench**: For schema design and database management.
- **MySQL Server**: For database hosting and execution.
- **CSV Files**: Source of raw data.

---

## Queries for Validation
- Sample queries for testing relationships and insights are included in the project files.

## Conclusion
This project transformed raw spreadsheet data into a scalable and reliable relational database. The design ensures data integrity, supports business growth, and provides actionable insights for Greenspot Grocer.
